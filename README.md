# NLP_Sentiment_Analysis
Natural Language Processing (NLP) project for Semantics Analysis using Python and NLTK library.

## Overview
This project performs sentiment and semantic analysis on text data using the NLTK library. It includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization techniques.

## Features
- Text Preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming, lemmatization)
- Sentiment Analysis
- Data Visualization
- POS Tagging
- Word Frequency Analysis

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow (optional, if using advanced models)

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages. Download the necessary NLTK data before running the notebook.

## Benefits
- Helps in understanding the sentiment of large datasets quickly
- Extracts meaningful patterns from textual data
- Supports decision-making based on textual insights
- Can be extended to build chatbots, recommendation systems, and text classifiers

## Usage
Open `NLP.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Run the cells sequentially and follow the instructions for uploading and analyzing your dataset.
